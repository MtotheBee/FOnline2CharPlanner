FOnline2CharPlanner
===================

A program to virtually plan your character in a post-apo MMO called FOnline 2

Fallout Online 2 is a free, fanmade post-apocalyptic RPGMMO based on the original games "Fallout" and "Fallout 2". Like in many MMO's you'll first have to create and register a character, with which you will play with. 

The process of planning a character can be easy or painful, depending on it's purpose ingame. This planner helps you to plan your character right from the scratch - including all elements like perks, skills, additional boosts and so on - to see, how he will look in the end and which statistics he will have.

This program is written in Visual Basic (don't ask me "y u coding in VB" :) ), using the Visual Studio 2010 IDE. To use it you'll have to have .NET installed (usually this is by default the case on Windows). 

I decided to upload this project, so that others may help or continue my work, because there are still many things which could be added to this planner.

Some words on the files i uploaded:

The directories and files represent the complete Visual Studio project, including the project file (*.sln) aswell as all the classes and every resources etc. .

Here's the list of all the classes, the program uses:

Form1.vb - Main Class
CharBaseStats.vb - used to get or set the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. data
CharPerks.vb - used to handle the selection of perks and their effects
CharSkills.vb - used to handle the changes of skills
CharTraits.vb - used to handle the effects traits have, if you choose them
CharStatistics.vb - used to handle, display and get or set different statistics of the character

There are still some things, that could be added:

- simulation of drugs
- calculation of HitChance according to character and equipment (not really necessary imo because there are already some good calculators for these out there)
- Save/Load feature (in development, not yet implemented but already can be found in code)
- <your suggestion here>

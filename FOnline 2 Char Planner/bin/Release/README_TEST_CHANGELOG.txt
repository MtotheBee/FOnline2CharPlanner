- added SAVE/LOAD feature

NOTE to Testers:

Thanks for trying/testing it out. The main issue is to test the new SAVE/LOAD feature. You now can save a build (at any time from level 1) into a txt file and load it later on.

Also. If you load a build later on you will be able to get back to your previous levels like you can in normal mode.

Programwise the critical things are to reload the correct values of Statistics, Skillpoints, Perks/Quests and so on...well pretty much everything that has a number :D. So you should have a look if everything is loaded correctly like you saved it before.

Known Issues:

- The items within the Perk/Traits-Taken List will most likely not be in the same order when you load the build later on. If this isn't much of a problem i'd keep it this way for now.

Some planned things:

There's a new fancy "Drugs" Panel. At the moment this isn't working yet but i decided to let you have a look at the design of it. In case there's something you would change or disagree with please report it to me.
